Nsync_v1 is a java based chat application.

I created this as an assignment of Computer Networks Subject to show live chat and screen mirroring between two devices,
later I added performance, remote control, media control, screenshot capture as gimmick..

you can directly run by clicking the executibles 
OR
1. compile javac Server.java Client.java
2. run java Server.java Client.java

note: both client and server files need to be connected through the IP address meanwhile loop back address can be used to testing purpose on single device.
